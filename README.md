# PHPDoc to reStructuredText

Doc2rst generates 
[reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) 
from PHP-source trees. 
The generated reStructuredText than again can act as a source for 
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html), 
the versatile tool that builds -amongst others- html.

Doc2rst is written in PHP.
